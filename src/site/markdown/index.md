The [Digitising Scotland project][9], funded by ESRC grant [ES/K00574X/1][1], will digitise the 24 million Scottish
vital events record images (births, marriages and deaths) since 1855. This will allow research access to
individual-level information on some 18 million individuals – a large proportion of those who have lived in Scotland
since 1855. At the moment these records are kept as indexed images accessible from [Scotland's People][2], but this
means that to extract data for research projects a researcher must first search for an individual record by name, and
then manually transcribe the information they need themselves (eg cause of death, occupation, etc). This has made any
large-scale research project impossible – a situation that the Digitising Scotland project will change.

In the School of Computer Science we are currently applying machine learning techniques to automate the classification
of occupations and causes of death from these records to standard classifications ([HISCO][3] and [ICD-10][4]
respectively). We are also in the planning stages of the linkage process, which will establish links between related
records to determine genealogical structures. The people involved are listed [here][5].
