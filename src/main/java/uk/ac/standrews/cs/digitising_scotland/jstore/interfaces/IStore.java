/**
 * This interface is used to encode the type of a Store within the system.
 * The Stores are implemented as a Hierarchy in which there is one instance of the Store (per node).
 * Each Store can contain a multiplicity of Repositories (implementing @class IRepository).
 * Each repository can contain buckets (implementing at least @class IBucket).
 * Buckets contain LXP (labelled cross product) records.
 * Repositories (Repos) and buckets may be deleted.
 * The reason this model was adopted was to be permit buckets to be clustered together into local groups.
 * For example, buckets of blocked records may be clustered together into a single repo.
 * Another example is the types repo which contains 2 different buckets used to represent different aspects of the type system.
