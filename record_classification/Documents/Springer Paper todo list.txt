Works on comments from Kayes: High Importance
	Correctness measures when using only unique records
	How much data can be classified using exact match only
	Cost Benefit analysis for automatic coding in terms of cost and time.
	Time estimations for both human and ml etc


Give figures for micro/macro precision and recall. 
Possible more advanced string techniques?


Figures for:
	 Exact match only
	 Unique only
	 ML results on only non exact matched unique.
	 

Feedback from conference comittee:
	Discuss exact nature of features
	Distribution of features across training and test sets, analysis of overlap
	Possible visualization of the classification result or the feature space, a frequency table of description terms, etc. could provide some insight in the nature of 	this task in terms of feature and cluster separation.
	Possible analysis of other string based approaches such as overlapping terms, overlapping hgh-entropy terms, bag-of-words Jaccard index, ontology-based graph distance 	of terms of corpus descriptions to terms in HISCO descriptions, etc. etc.
	
Possible further analysis of best technique, improvements for it in the scope of this problem




Section on what the system looks like now, possible trailer for next paper on mulitple classification, preview different techniques etc
